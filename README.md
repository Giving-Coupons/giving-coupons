### Overview

Giving Coupons aims to increase fundraising donations and raise awareness about charities a primary donor wishes to support by distributing coupons. Coupon recipients get to choose which charity receives the money specified and can choose to make a personal contribution if they wish to do so. The end goal of Giving Coupons is to encourage more Singaporeans to donate and change the way we give to build a city of good!

### How does Giving Coupons work?

1. A donor pledges to donate a sum of money to one or more charities by starting a campaign on Giving Coupons.
1. Giving Coupons will split the pledged amount into coupons. Coupons are distributed to the public or organisations.
1. Coupon recipients can redeem it to choose where the money goes and learn about the charities and their impact during the redemption process.
1. They may choose to add a personal contribution during the coupon redemption process. Or donate directly to charities through our campaigns.
