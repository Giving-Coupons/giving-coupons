## Overview

Giving Coupons aims to increase the fundraising ROI on charitable donations and raise awareness about charities that the donor wishes to support by giving out donation coupons. Recipients of the coupon get to decide which charity receives the money specified, and can choose to top it up with their own money. The end goal of Giving Coupons is to encourage more Singaporeans to donate.

How Giving Coupons works for a campaign.

1. A campaign in Giving Coupons kicks off when a primary donor pledges to donate a lump sum for one or more causes.
1. The lump sum is then represented by coupons of smaller denominations. For example, a donation of $1000 could be split into 100 $10 coupons.
1. Giving Coupons then distributes these coupons to a targeted group of people that they want to encourage to donate. These people are coupon recipients.
1. Coupon recipients scan the coupon and can browse through the charities the money could go to. They gain awareness, while making their choice. While doing this, they can choose to make an additional personal contribution too, becoming a secondary donor.
