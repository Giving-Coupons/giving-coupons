### Overview

Giving coupons is a social enterprise project with a simple idea — spread the joy of giving. There are so many worthy causes that are in need of funds, and we believe that people would give more if they had the right nudge, and Giving Coupons does that for them. Our aim is to encourage more Singaporeans to donate and foster a stronger culture of giving.

### How does Giving Coupons work?

1. A sponsor pledges to donate a sum of money to one or more charities by starting a campaign on Giving Coupons.
1. Giving Coupons will split the pledged amount into coupons. Coupons are distributed to the public or organisations.
1. Coupon recipients can redeem it to choose where the money goes and learn about the charities and their impact during the redemption process.
1. They may choose to add a personal contribution during the coupon redemption process. Or donate directly to charities through our campaigns.

### What have we done so far?

We've distributed hundreds of coupons in NUS and raised thousands of dollars for local beneficiaries. We learnt that the idea works — 1 in 4 people gave at least $10 of their own money when redeeming the coupon, and the average person tops up the coupon value by 33%. Learn more in our [campaign report](./campaign-report.pdf).
